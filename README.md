📊 Sleep Disorder Analysis – Interactive Excel Dashboard
📌 Overview

This project explores a Sleep Disorder Dataset and presents insights through an interactive Excel Dashboard.
The goal was to practice data analysis, visualization, and dashboard design in Excel, while uncovering patterns in sleep quality, disorders, stress, and lifestyle factors.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze sleep disorders (Insomnia, Sleep Apnea, None).
Study age group & gender distribution of disorders.
Examine impact of stress levels, quality of sleep, and blood pressure.
Visualize insights interactively using Excel slicers, pivot tables, and charts.
